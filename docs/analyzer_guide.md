# Summit SEO Analyzer Guide

## Introduction

Summit SEO includes several analyzer modules that evaluate different aspects of a website. This guide explains how each analyzer works, what it checks for, and how to interpret the results.

## Analyzer Types

### SEO Analyzer

The SEO Analyzer evaluates search engine optimization factors on your website.

#### What It Checks

  - Robots meta directives
  - Canonical URLs

- **Heading Structure**:
  - H1 tag presence and uniqueness
  - Heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3, etc.)
  - Keyword usage in headings

- **Content Quality**:
  - Content length (minimum 300 words recommended)
  - Keyword density
  - Readability score
  - Duplicate content
  - Thin content pages

- **URL Structure**:
  - URL length and format
  - Use of keywords in URLs
  - Parameters and session IDs

  - Responsive design elements
  - Touch elements spacing

- **Schema Markup**:
  - Presence of structured data
  - Schema.org implementation
  - Rich snippet potential

#### Scoring

The SEO score is calculated based on a weighted average of all SEO factors. Critical issues like missing title tags or broken links have a higher impact on the score than minor issues like suboptimal image filenames.

### Performance Analyzer

The Performance Analyzer evaluates your website's loading speed and performance.

#### What It Checks

- **Page Load Metrics**:
  - First Contentful Paint (FCP)
  - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
  - Time to Interactive (TTI)
  - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
  - First Input Delay (FID)

- **Resource Optimization**:
  - File sizes (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
  - Image compression
  - Next-gen image formats (WebP, AVIF)
  - Minification of code

- **Caching**:
  - Browser cache settings
  - Cache-Control headers

  - TLS negotiation time

#### Scoring

The Performance score is based on the Core Web Vitals metrics and other performance factors. The scoring algorithm follows a similar approach to Google's Lighthouse, with higher weight given to user-centric metrics like LCP and CLS.

### Security Analyzer

The Security Analyzer checks for security vulnerabilities and best practices.

#### What It Checks

#### Scoring

The Accessibility score is based on WCAG 2.1 guidelines. Issues are categorized by levels (A, AA, AAA) with Level A issues having the highest impact on the score.

## Meta Analyzer

The Meta Analyzer combines results from all individual analyzers to provide an overall assessment of your website.

### Overall Score Calculation

The overall score is a weighted average of all individual analyzer scores:

- SEO: 30%
- Performance: 25%
- Security: 25%
- Accessibility: 20%

The weights can be customized based on your priorities.

### Interpreting Results

- **90-100**: Excellent - Your website meets best practices across all categories
- **80-89**: Good - Your website performs well but has room for minor improvements
- **70-79**: Fair - Several issues need attention, but no critical problems
- **Below 70**: Needs Improvement - Multiple important issues need to be addressed

## Customizing Analyzer Settings

You can customize analyzer settings when starting a new analysis:

### Analysis Depth

- **Basic**: Quick scan of the homepage and a few key pages
- **Standard**: Analyzes the homepage plus up to 25 linked pages
- **Deep**: Comprehensive analysis of up to 100 pages

### Custom Checks

You can also enable or disable specific checks:

- JavaScript Analysis: Enable for single-page applications or JavaScript-heavy sites
- Mobile Analysis: Specifically check mobile-friendliness
- Security Scan Depth: Basic, Standard, or Intensive

## Best Practices for Analysis

1. **Run a complete analysis monthly** to track improvements over time
2. **Focus on critical issues first**, especially security vulnerabilities
3. **Address SEO issues by priority**, starting with technical issues before content optimization
4. **Improve performance gradually**, beginning with the most impactful optimizations
5. **Fix accessibility issues by WCAG level**, starting with Level A violations

## Troubleshooting

- **Analysis timeout**: For large sites, try analyzing specific sections or reducing the crawl depth
- **JavaScript execution issues**: Enable JavaScript analysis for single-page applications
- **Incomplete results**: Check if login requirements or robots.txt restrictions are blocking the analyzer
- **False positives**: Report these through the feedback system for continuous improvement
