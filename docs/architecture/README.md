## System Architecture

Summit SEO is built on a modular architecture consisting of four primary components:

1. **Collectors**: Gather raw data from websites or files
2. **Processors**: Transform raw data into structured formats
3. **Analyzers**: Generate SEO insights from processed data
4. **Reporters**: Create reports in various formats

Each component follows a consistent design pattern:
- Abstract base class defining the interface
- Factory class for component creation
- Multiple concrete implementations

## Key Design Patterns

- **Factory Pattern**: Used for component creation and management
- **Strategy Pattern**: For different implementations with the same interface
- **Dependency Injection**: For flexible component configuration
- **Observer Pattern**: For progress monitoring (planned)

```

## Extension Points

The system is designed to be extensible at multiple points:

1. **New Collectors**: For additional data sources
2. **New Processors**: For handling different file types
3. **New Analyzers**: For specialized SEO analysis
4. **New Reporters**: For additional output formats

## Technical Stack

- Python 3.8+
- Asynchronous API (asyncio)
- Type hints for improved code quality
- Factory pattern for component creation
- Comprehensive testing framework
