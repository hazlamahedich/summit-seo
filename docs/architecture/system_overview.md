# System Overview

## Introduction

Summit SEO is a comprehensive tool for analyzing websites and generating actionable SEO recommendations. The system is designed to be modular, extensible, and efficient, capable of processing and analyzing various aspects of web content.

## System Architecture

The Summit SEO architecture follows a pipeline model where data flows through a series of components:

1. **Collection**: Raw data (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) is gathered from websites or files
2. **Processing**: Raw data is processed into structured formats suitable for analysis
3. **Analysis**: Processed data is analyzed to generate SEO insights and recommendations
4. **Reporting**: Analysis results are transformed into various report formats

## Data Flow

1. **Collection**: The Collector fetches raw data from a website or file
2. **Processing**: The Processor transforms raw data into structured formats
3. **Analysis**: The Analyzer evaluates the processed data and generates insights
4. **Reporting**: The Reporter formats the analysis results into the desired output

Each step in this pipeline is implemented as a separate module with its own set of responsibilities. This separation of concerns allows for flexibility and extensibility.

## Asynchronous Design

The Summit SEO system uses asynchronous programming (asyncio) to improve performance:

- All major operations are implemented as asynchronous methods
- Concurrent processing of multiple tasks
- Efficient handling of I/O-bound operations
- Non-blocking execution model

## Configuration System

Each component can be configured through a dictionary-based configuration system:

- Common configuration options are standardized
- Component-specific options are supported
- Default values for common scenarios
- Configuration validation at initialization

## Error Handling

The system implements a comprehensive error handling strategy:

- Custom exception hierarchy for domain-specific errors
- Validation at multiple levels
- Graceful degradation on errors
- Detailed error messages for debugging

## Future Extensions

The architecture is designed to support future extensions:

- Phase 3 analyzers (Security, Performance, Schema.org, etc.)
- Additional report formats
- Machine learning integration
- Performance optimization
