# Summit SEO Project Intelligence

## Architecture Patterns

### Component Structure
- All analyzers inherit from BaseAnalyzer class
- Analyzers implement the _analyze method as their core functionality
- Results are standardized using the AnalysisResult class
- Factory pattern used for analyzer creation and registration
- Each analyzer implements a compute_score method with its own scoring logic

### Security Analyzer Patterns
- Modular security checks separated into individual methods
- Each security check returns a severity level and remediation steps
- Security issues are categorized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Overall security score starts at 100 and deducts based on severity
- HTML parsing leverages BeautifulSoup throughout the codebase
- Regular expressions used for sensitive data pattern matching
- External resource detection uses URL parsing and protocol validation

## Code Conventions

### Naming Conventions
- Analyzer classes use CamelCase and end with "Analyzer"
- Internal methods start with underscore (e.g., _analyze_https)
- Constants are UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Utility functions are snake_case
- Test methods follow pytest's test_* naming convention

### Implementation Patterns
- Private methods are used for internal functionality
- Public methods provide the interface for external usage
- Configuration parameters are passed via constructor
- Analysis results include both scores and detailed findings
- Security checks return tuples with (severity, message, remediation)
- Severity levels use the Severity enum (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)

## Testing Patterns

### Test Structure
- Each analyzer has a dedicated test file in tests/analyzer/
- Tests use pytest fixtures for setup and teardown
- Mock HTML content is used for testing parsing logic
- Expected results are explicitly defined for validation
- Edge cases are tested separately from normal cases
- Integration with factory is tested in factory tests

### Security Testing
- Each security check has dedicated test cases
- Tests validate both positive (secure) and negative (insecure) scenarios
- Mock HTTP responses are used to simulate headers
- Severity levels are validated in tests
- Remediation recommendations are verified

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- Class docstrings explain purpose and usage
- Method docstrings follow Google style format
- Parameters and return values are documented
- Public methods have comprehensive docstrings
- Private methods have brief explanations

### Project Documentation
- Memory Bank maintains current project status
- Design decisions are documented in systemPatterns.md
- Technical context is maintained in techContext.md
- Active development focus in activeContext.md
- Implementation progress tracked in progress.md

## Development Workflow

### Feature Implementation
1. Update memory bank with design plans
2. Create test file with comprehensive test cases
3. Implement base class structure
4. Implement individual methods
5. Register with factory
6. Run and fix tests
7. Update documentation
8. Update memory bank with completion status

### Security Analyzer Pattern
1. Implement base security checks first (HTTPS, cookies)
2. Add detection mechanisms for each security issue
3. Implement severity classification
4. Add detailed remediation recommendations
5. Implement scoring algorithm
6. Test against various security scenarios
7. Document security methodology

## Known Issues and Challenges

### Factory Implementation
- Type checking issues in factory implementation
- Inheritance validation needs refinement
- Factory tests failing need to be addressed

### Meta Analyzer Issues
- Import errors in the test file for Meta Analyzer

### Project Optimization Needs
- Performance optimization for large sites needed
- Memory usage can be improved for complex parsing operations

## User Experience Insights

### Security Analyzer Output
- Technical users need detailed findings with code references
- Non-technical users need clear explanations of security implications
- All users benefit from prioritized recommendations
- Remediation steps should be actionable with examples
- Visual scoring helps communicate severity effectively

## Future Development Guidance

### Security Analyzer Extensions
- Add more sophisticated XSS detection patterns
- Enhance outdated library detection with broader database
- Implement cookie policy compliance checking
- Add CSRF protection validation
- Enhance API key pattern detection with more formats

### Integration Opportunities
- Security Analyzer findings should influence overall SEO score
- Security recommendations should link to documentation
- Security checks should be configurable for different compliance standards
