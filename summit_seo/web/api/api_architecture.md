# Summit SEO REST API Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the REST API architecture for the Summit SEO application. The API will serve as the backend for the web UI, providing endpoints for user authentication, project management, analysis execution, and results retrieval. It follows RESTful principles and is designed for scalability, security, and maintainability.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: FastAPI
  - High performance, easy to learn
  - Automatic OpenAPI documentation
  - Built-in validation with Pydantic
  - Asynchronous support
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
  - Stateless authentication
  - Support for role-based access control
- **Database ORM**: SQLAlchemy
  - Compatible with multiple SQL backends
  - Comprehensive query capabilities
  - Migration support via Alembic
- **API Documentation**: Swagger UI and ReDoc (via FastAPI)
- **Testing**: Pytest with async support

## API Design Principles

1. **RESTful Design**
   - Resource-based URLs
   - Proper use of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - Stateless interactions
   - Clear response codes

2. **Versioning**
   - API version in URL path: `/api/v1/`
   - Backward compatibility within major versions

3. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Fine-grained permissions

4. **Consistency**
   - Consistent error formats
   - Standard response structure
   - Uniform resource naming

5. **Documentation**
   - OpenAPI (Swagger) integration
   - Examples for each endpoint
   - Schema documentation

6. **Performance**
   - Pagination for large result sets
   - Caching strategies
   - Asynchronous operations for long-running tasks

## API Structure

### Base URL

```
https://{hostname}/api/v1
```

PUT    /settings/analyzers            # Update analyzer configurations
```

### System Endpoints

```
GET    /system/status                 # System status and health check
GET    /system/metrics                # System performance metrics (admin only)
```

## Request/Response Format

### Standard Response Format

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": { ... },
  "meta": {
    "pagination": {
      "total": 100,
      "page": 1,
      "per_page": 20,
      "pages": 5
    }
  }
}
```

### Error Response Format

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": {
    "code": "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "The requested resource was not found",
    "details": { ... }
  }
}
```

## Authentication

### JWT Structure

- **Header**: Algorithm and token type
- **Payload**:
  - `sub`: Subject (user ID)
  - `role`: User role
  - `iat`: Issued at
  - `exp`: Expiration time
  - `jti`: JWT ID (for token revocation)

### Authentication Flow

1. Client authenticates with username/password and receives JWT
2. JWT is included in Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer {token}`
3. Server validates token on each request
4. Refresh token mechanism for extending sessions

## Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control

- **Admin**: Full system access
- **Manager**: Full project access, limited system access
- **Analyst**: Read/write access to assigned projects
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to assigned projects

### Permission Model

- Object-level permissions for projects
- Action-based permissions (view, create, edit, delete)
- Permission inheritance through roles

## Rate Limiting

- Rate limits based on user tiers
- Headers for rate limit information:
  - `X-RateLimit-Limit`
  - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`
  - `X-RateLimit-Reset`
- Graduated rate limiting for different endpoints

## Pagination

- Limit-offset pagination for all list endpoints
- Page-based navigation with `page` and `per_page` parameters
- Total count in metadata
- Links to first, previous, next, and last pages in metadata

## Filtering and Sorting

- Filter parameters with consistent naming:
  - `filter[field]=value`
  - `filter[created_after]=timestamp`
- Sorting with `sort` parameter:
  - `sort=field` (ascending)
  - `sort=-field` (descending)
- Multiple sort fields allowed: `sort=-priority,created_at`

## API Versioning Strategy

- URL-based versioning: `/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/`
- Major version increments for breaking changes
- Minor version changes maintain compatibility
- Deprecation process:
  - Deprecation header: `X-API-Deprecated`
  - Documentation of deprecated features
  - Minimum 6-month deprecation period

## Caching Strategy

- ETags for client-side caching
- Cache-Control headers
- Cache invalidation on updates
- Redis-based server-side cache for frequent queries

## Error Handling

### HTTP Status Codes

- `200 OK`: Successful request
- `201 Created`: Resource created
- `204 No Content`: Success with no response body
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication required
- `403 Forbidden`: Permission denied
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found
- `422 Unprocessable Entity`: Validation error
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server error

### Error Codes

Standard error codes for common scenarios:
- `AUTHENTICATION_FAILED`: Authentication failed
- `INVALID_CREDENTIALS`: Invalid username/password
- `TOKEN_EXPIRED`: JWT has expired
- `PERMISSION_DENIED`: User lacks required permission
- `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND`: Requested resource not found
- `VALIDATION_ERROR`: Request data fails validation
- `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`: Too many requests
- `INTERNAL_ERROR`: Unexpected server error

## Asynchronous Operations

- Long-running operations return `202 Accepted`
- Job status endpoint for polling: `/jobs/{job_id}`
- Optional webhook callbacks for job completion
- Background task processing with Celery

## Monitoring and Logging

- Request/response logging
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking
- Usage analytics
- Audit trail for security-sensitive operations

## Security Considerations

- HTTPS for all API communication
- JWT token security (proper algorithms, expiration)
- Input validation for all parameters
- Protection against common attacks:
  - SQL injection
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
  - Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
  - Parameter tampering
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
