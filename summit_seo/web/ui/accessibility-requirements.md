# Summit SEO - Accessibility Requirements

## Overview

This document outlines the accessibility requirements for the Summit SEO web interface. Our goal is to create an inclusive experience that meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance, ensuring that users with disabilities can effectively use our application.

## Compliance Standard

- **Target Standard**: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA
- **Implementation Timeframe**: All new components must meet these requirements prior to release
- **Evaluation**: Automated testing combined with manual accessibility audits

## Core Requirements

### 1. Perceivable

#### Adaptable Content
- Information must be presentable in different ways
- Layout must work in both portrait and landscape orientations
- Content must be structured with proper semantic HTML

#### Distinguishable Content
- Text must have sufficient contrast ratio (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Color must not be the only means of conveying information
- Text must be resizable up to 200% without loss of content or functionality
- Audio control mechanisms must be provided for any auto-playing audio

### 2. Operable

#### Keyboard Accessibility

- Ensure touch targets are at least 44x44 pixels
- Provide alternatives for motion actuation

### 3. Understandable

#### Readable
- Identify language of page programmatically
- Identify language changes within content
- Explain unusual words and abbreviations

#### Predictable
- Navigation must be consistent across the application
- Components that appear on multiple pages must behave consistently
- Changes of context must only occur when initiated by user

#### Input Assistance
- Clear labels for all form elements
- Error identification must be specific and descriptive
- Error suggestions must be provided when possible
- Error prevention for legal, financial, or data submission contexts

### 4. Robust

#### Compatible
- All HTML must be valid and well-formed
- ARIA should be used appropriately to enhance accessibility
- Custom controls must have appropriate roles and states
- Ensure compatibility with assistive technologies

## Component-Specific Requirements

### Navigation
- Active state must be visually distinct and programmatically determinable
- Dropdown menus must be keyboard accessible
- Mobile navigation must be accessible via touch and screen readers

### Forms
- All inputs must have associated labels
- Required fields must be clearly indicated
- Form validation errors must be associated with relevant fields
- Group related form elements using fieldset and legend

### Buttons and Interactive Elements
- Must be keyboard focusable and operable
- States (hover, focus, active, disabled) must be clearly indicated
- Touch targets minimum size of 44x44 pixels
- Focus indicators must be visible (minimum 3:1 contrast ratio)

### Cards and Containers
- Interactive cards must be navigable via keyboard
- Focus order within cards must be logical
- Cards must maintain adequate spacing for touch interactions

### Modals and Dialogs
- Focus must be trapped within open modal
- Focus must return to triggering element when closed
- Provide close mechanism via keyboard (ESC key)
- Must be properly announced to screen readers

### Data Tables
- Use proper table markup (<table>, <th>, <td>)
- Include proper scope attributes for header cells
- Provide caption or accessible name for tables
- Complex tables should include row/column headers

### Data Visualization
- Provide text alternatives for charts and graphs
- Do not rely solely on color to convey information
- Ensure sufficient contrast for all chart elements
- Provide keyboard access to interactive chart elements

## Testing and Validation

### Automated Testing
- Implement accessibility testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Tools to consider:
  - axe-core
  - WAVE
  - Lighthouse
  - pa11y

### Manual Testing
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing with:
  - NVDA and Chrome on Windows
  - VoiceOver and Safari on macOS
  - TalkBack and Chrome on Android
  - VoiceOver and Safari on iOS
- Color contrast verification
- Zoom testing (up to 200%)

### User Testing
- Include users with disabilities in testing activities
- Test with participants who use various assistive technologies

## Implementation Guidelines

### React Component Development
- Use semantic HTML elements whenever possible
- Implement proper ARIA attributes when HTML semantics are insufficient
- Manage focus appropriately, especially for dynamic content
- Test all components with keyboard navigation

### CSS Implementation
- Maintain sufficient color contrast
- Design focus indicators that meet contrast requirements
- Use relative units (rem, em) for text sizing
- Ensure text remains visible during font loading

### JavaScript Behaviors
- Use established design patterns for widgets (WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices)
- Manage focus for dynamically rendered content
- Ensure custom controls are keyboard accessible
- Provide appropriate feedback for user interactions
