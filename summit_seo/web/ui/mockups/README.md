# Summit SEO - Web UI Mockups

## Overview

These mockups represent the initial UI design for the Summit SEO web interface. They follow modern UI/UX principles with a clean, professional design that prioritizes usability and clarity.

## Design Principles

1. **Clarity** - Clear information hierarchy and visual distinction between different types of information
2. **Consistency** - Consistent design patterns and UI elements across all pages
3. **Responsiveness** - Layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
4. **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 compliant design elements with proper contrast and focus states
5. **Data Visualization** - Clear visual representation of analysis data
6. **Actionable Insights** - Emphasis on providing actionable recommendations

## Layout Structure

All pages follow a consistent layout structure:

1. **Sidebar** - Navigation menu for accessing different sections of the application
2. **Header** - Page title and primary actions
3. **Content Area** - Main content with cards and sections
4. **Cards** - Content is organized into distinct card components with clear headers

## Mockup Pages

### 1. Dashboard (`dashboard.html`)

The dashboard provides an overview of the website's SEO health with:
- Overall SEO score with trend indicator
- Critical issues count with trend indicator
- Issue breakdown by severity
- Category scores with visual indicators
- Quick win recommendations prioritized by impact

### 2. Analysis Results (`analysis_results.html`)

The analysis results page shows detailed findings for a website analysis:
- Site summary with analysis metadata
- Issues categorized by severity (Critical, Warning, Notice)
- Detailed issue cards with:
  - Issue description
  - Code examples
  - Detailed recommendations
  - Impact assessment
  - Action buttons (Learn More, Ignore, Fix Issue)

### 3. Site Settings (`site_settings.html`)

The settings page allows users to configure their project and analysis preferences:
- Project information configuration
- Analysis parameters (components, crawl depth, etc.)
- Notification preferences
- Form controls including:
  - Text inputs
  - Checkboxes
  - Radio buttons
  - Toggles
  - Sliders
  - Tag inputs

## Component System

These mockups use a consistent set of UI components:

1. **Cards** - Container components with consistent padding and styling
2. **Buttons** - Primary, secondary, and danger variants with consistent styling
3. **Form Controls** - Consistent styling for inputs, labels, and hints
4. **Progress Indicators** - Visual representation of scores and progress
5. **Tags** - For displaying and managing lists of values
6. **Severity Indicators** - Consistent color-coding for different severity levels
7. **Impact Indicators** - Dot-based visualization of impact levels

## Responsive Considerations

While these mockups primarily showcase desktop layouts, they use:
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for flexible layouts
- Relative units (rem) for scalable typography
- Design patterns that can adapt to smaller screens

## Implementation Notes

These static HTML mockups serve as a visual reference for implementing the actual React-based UI. When implementing:

1. Extract common components into React components
2. Implement responsive breakpoints for mobile devices
3. Add interactive behaviors and state management
4. Connect to the API for dynamic data
5. Implement accessibility features including keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes

## Next Steps

1. Review mockups with stakeholders
2. Refine based on feedback
3. Create additional mockups for:
   - Login/Registration
   - User Profile
   - Reports Gallery
   - History/Comparison View
   - Help/Documentation
4. Begin React component implementation
