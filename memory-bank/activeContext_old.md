# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are currently focusing on the Supabase integration, API layer, and LLM capabilities for the Summit SEO project. We've successfully implemented the following components:

1. Core Supabase authentication setup
2. Integration of Supabase Auth with FastAPI
3. Middleware for JWT token validation
4. Authentication routers for signup, login, password reset, email verification, etc.
5. Dependencies for user authentication and authorization
6. Administrative system and settings endpoints
7. Database access service layer for managing users, projects, analyses, and settings
8. API routers for projects and analyses that utilize the service layer
9. Settings router with multi-scope configuration management
10. System router with health checks and system information endpoints
11. LiteLLM service layer integration for AI capabilities with multi-provider support
12. Comprehensive unit testing for the Settings Service using AsyncMock and isolation techniques

The database access service layer provides a clean interface to the Supabase database, handling CRUD operations, Row Level Security (RLS) bypass for admin operations, multi-tenant data isolation, and pagination/filtering/sorting for list operations.

The API routers have been implemented to provide RESTful endpoints that utilize the service layer. These routers include endpoints for:

- Projects: Creating, listing, retrieving, updating, and deleting projects
- Analyses: Creating analyses, retrieving analysis details, getting summaries, accessing findings and recommendations, and canceling analyses
- Settings: Managing application settings with different scopes (system, tenant, user)
- System: Retrieving system information, health checks, and service management

We've implemented a robust testing strategy for the Settings Service, creating comprehensive unit tests that completely isolate the service from external dependencies. Our approach uses AsyncMock to properly test asynchronous methods and achieves 95% test coverage for the Settings Service functionality. This testing strategy serves as a template for testing other services that rely on external dependencies like Supabase.

The newly implemented LLM service layer provides:
- Unified interface to different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Cohere)
- Support for local LLMs via Ollama integration
- Support for OpenRouter for production deployment
- Configuration for default and fallback models
- Error handling with automatic fallback strategies
- Cost tracking and budget management
- Optional response caching
- Support for synchronous and asynchronous operations
- Customizable model configurations through JSON
- Dynamic model discovery for Ollama
- Ability to register custom models programmatically

# Active Context: Database Schema Implementation and Next Steps

## Current Status

We've successfully implemented the database schema for the Summit SEO application's Supabase integration:

1. Completed database schema design with:
   - Core data tables (Users, Projects, Analysis, Findings, Recommendations)
   - SQL scripts for table creation with proper indexing
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies for secure multi-tenant data access
   - Database migration and versioning strategy
   - Comprehensive documentation of the database schema

2. Executed the SQL scripts in Supabase:
   - Created all tables, indexes, and enum types
   - Implemented Row Level Security policies
   - Made scripts idempotent (can run multiple times without errors)
   - Fixed issues with object existence checks

3. Installed necessary dependencies:
   - Added Supabase client libraries to requirements.txt
   - Updated project configuration for Supabase integration

## Schema Implementation Details

### Core Tables
- **User Authentication Tables**: `user`, `role`, `user_roles` for managing users and permissions
- **Multi-tenant Tables**: `tenant`, `tenant_user` for organization of users and projects
- **SEO Analysis Tables**: `project`, `analysis`, `finding`, `recommendation` for storing analysis results

### Security Model
- Row Level Security (RLS) is implemented to ensure proper data isolation
- User permissions are based on roles within the tenant
- Custom security functions for tenant membership and permission checking
- Admin users have system-wide access

### Migration Strategy
- SQL migration files in the `migrations` directory: 
  - `01_initial_schema.sql`: Creates all tables and indexes
  - `02_row_level_security.sql`: Implements RLS policies
- Python migration script (`db_migrate.py`) to manage and track migrations
- Idempotent scripts with existence checks for rerunning when needed

## Next Steps

Our immediate next steps are:

1. **Supabase Authentication Setup**: 
   - Configure authentication providers (email/password, OAuth)
   - Set up email templates for verification and password reset
   - Configure authentication settings (session duration, password policies)

2. **FastAPI Integration with Supabase**:
   - Create Supabase client configuration module
   - Implement authentication middleware for JWT validation
   - Create database access service layer for CRUD operations

3. **API Router Implementation**:
   - Implement authentication router
   - Implement projects router
   - Implement analysis router

## Technical Decisions

We've made these key technical decisions:

1. **UUID as Primary Keys**: Using UUID for all primary keys to ensure uniqueness across instances and support distributed systems.

2. **Soft Delete Pattern**: Implementing soft deletes with `is_deleted` flag rather than actual deletion to maintain data integrity and enable recovery.

3. **Tenant Isolation**: Using `tenant_id` in all tables to enable data partitioning by tenant, with RLS policies enforcing isolation.

4. **JSON/JSONB for Flexible Data**: Using JSONB columns for configuration settings, analysis results, and other semi-structured data.

5. **Common Base Models**: Using inheritance with `BaseModel` and `TenantModel` to ensure consistent fields and behavior across all entities.

6. **Idempotent Database Scripts**: Making all SQL scripts idempotent to allow for reliable deployments and migrations.

## Validation and Consistency

We've created tools to ensure schema consistency:

1. **validate_schema.py**: Validates that SQLAlchemy models match the database schema
2. **update_models.py**: Updates Python models to match the database schema

These tools ensure that the SQL schema and Python models remain in sync, preventing inconsistencies that could lead to runtime errors.

# Active Context: Database Schema Implementation and Next Steps

## Current Status

We've successfully implemented the database schema for the Summit SEO application's Supabase integration:

1. Completed database schema design with:
   - Core data tables (Users, Projects, Analysis, Findings, Recommendations)
   - SQL scripts for table creation with proper indexing
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies for secure multi-tenant data access
   - Database migration and versioning strategy
   - Comprehensive documentation of the database schema

2. Executed the SQL scripts in Supabase:
   - Created all tables, indexes, and enum types
   - Implemented Row Level Security policies
   - Made scripts idempotent (can run multiple times without errors)
   - Fixed issues with object existence checks

3. Installed necessary dependencies:
   - Added Supabase client libraries to requirements.txt
   - Updated project configuration for Supabase integration

## Schema Implementation Details

### Core Tables
- **User Authentication Tables**: `user`, `role`, `user_roles` for managing users and permissions
- **Multi-tenant Tables**: `tenant`, `tenant_user` for organization of users and projects
- **SEO Analysis Tables**: `project`, `analysis`, `finding`, `recommendation` for storing analysis results

### Security Model
- Row Level Security (RLS) is implemented to ensure proper data isolation
- User permissions are based on roles within the tenant
- Custom security functions for tenant membership and permission checking
- Admin users have system-wide access

### Migration Strategy
- SQL migration files in the `migrations` directory: 
  - `01_initial_schema.sql`: Creates all tables and indexes
  - `02_row_level_security.sql`: Implements RLS policies
- Python migration script (`db_migrate.py`) to manage and track migrations
- Idempotent scripts with existence checks for rerunning when needed

## Next Steps

Our immediate next steps are:

1. **Supabase Authentication Setup**: 
   - Configure authentication providers (email/password, OAuth)
   - Set up email templates for verification and password reset
   - Configure authentication settings (session duration, password policies)

2. **FastAPI Integration with Supabase**:
   - Create Supabase client configuration module
   - Implement authentication middleware for JWT validation
   - Create database access service layer for CRUD operations

3. **API Router Implementation**:
   - Implement authentication router
   - Implement projects router
   - Implement analysis router

## Technical Decisions

We've made these key technical decisions:

1. **UUID as Primary Keys**: Using UUID for all primary keys to ensure uniqueness across instances and support distributed systems.

2. **Soft Delete Pattern**: Implementing soft deletes with `is_deleted` flag rather than actual deletion to maintain data integrity and enable recovery.

3. **Tenant Isolation**: Using `tenant_id` in all tables to enable data partitioning by tenant, with RLS policies enforcing isolation.

4. **JSON/JSONB for Flexible Data**: Using JSONB columns for configuration settings, analysis results, and other semi-structured data.

5. **Common Base Models**: Using inheritance with `BaseModel` and `TenantModel` to ensure consistent fields and behavior across all entities.

6. **Idempotent Database Scripts**: Making all SQL scripts idempotent to allow for reliable deployments and migrations.

## Validation and Consistency

We've created tools to ensure schema consistency:

1. **validate_schema.py**: Validates that SQLAlchemy models match the database schema
2. **update_models.py**: Updates Python models to match the database schema

These tools ensure that the SQL schema and Python models remain in sync, preventing inconsistencies that could lead to runtime errors.
