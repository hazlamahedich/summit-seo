# Summit SEO - Project Brief

## Overview
Summit SEO is a comprehensive SEO analysis toolkit designed to provide in-depth analysis and recommendations for website optimization. The project aims to create a modular, extensible framework for SEO analysis that can be used by developers, SEO professionals, and content creators.

## Core Objectives
1. Provide comprehensive SEO analysis for websites
2. Generate actionable recommendations for SEO improvement
3. Support various input methods (URL, HTML content, local files)
4. Deliver results in multiple formats (JSON, HTML, PDF, CSV)
5. Maintain a modular architecture for easy extension and customization

## Architecture
The system follows a modular architecture with four main components:

1. **Collectors** - Responsible for gathering data from various sources (URLs, files, etc.)
2. **Processors** - Parse and preprocess the collected data into a standard format
3. **Analyzers** - Perform analysis on the processed data and generate recommendations
4. **Reporters** - Format and present the analysis results in various formats

Each component follows a factory pattern, allowing for easy extension and customization.
