# Technical Context

## Development Environment
- Python 3.8+
- Virtual Environment (venv)
- macOS development platform
- Visual Studio Code with Python extensions

## Dependencies (Active)
- beautifulsoup4 (HTML parsing and web scraping)
- requests (HTTP requests)
- aiohttp (Asynchronous HTTP requests)
- aiofiles (Asynchronous file operations)
- pytest (testing framework)
- pytest-asyncio (asynchronous testing support)
- reportlab (PDF generation)
- jinja2 (HTML templating for reports)
- pillow (Image processing support)
- typing-extensions (advanced type annotations)
- black (code formatting)
- mypy (type checking)

## Technical Architecture
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Factory pattern for component creation and management
- Asynchronous API for improved performance
- Type hints throughout the codebase
- Comprehensive error handling

## Technical Constraints
- Python compatibility (3.8+)
- Memory efficiency for large websites
- Processing speed requirements
- API rate limits for web scraping
- PDF generation quality and customization options

## Development Workflow
1. Clone repository
2. Activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest
   ```

## Code Quality Standards
- Type hints throughout the codebase
- Comprehensive docstring documentation
- Unit test coverage (target: 80%+)
- PEP 8 compliance
- Consistent error handling patterns

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Test resources for realistic testing scenarios
- Performance benchmarks (planned)

## Security Considerations
- API key management
- Rate limiting for external services
- Data privacy and handling
- Error handling to prevent information leakage
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks

## Phase 3 Technical Considerations
- Performance optimization through caching and parallelization
- Advanced data visualization in reports
- Machine learning integration for intelligent recommendations
- Expanded test coverage and performance benchmarks
- Documentation generation from docstrings
- CI/CD pipeline setup for automated testing
