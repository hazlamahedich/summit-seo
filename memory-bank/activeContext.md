   - Added color-coded output based on progress stages
   - Implemented real-time updating of progress information
   - Integrated with the progress tracking component

### Next Steps

1. Complete remaining User Experience Enhancement components:
   - ✅ Enhance error reporting with actionable suggestions
   - ✅ Implement interactive mode for CLI operations
   - ✅ Create customizable output formats
   - ✅ Create robust logging system

2. Finalize documentation for Phase 3 components:
   - Document all public APIs for CLI components
   - Add usage examples for different output formats
   - Create comprehensive guide for interactive CLI mode
   - Update system architecture documentation

3. Finalize all Phase 3 components and begin planning for Phase 4, focusing on:
   - Integration with external tools
   - Advanced workflow automation
   - Enterprise features

### Technical Decisions

- Used abstract base classes and interfaces for all components to ensure extensibility
- Implemented factories for component creation to support dependency injection
- Created comprehensive test suites with both unit and integration tests
- Used asynchronous methods where appropriate for performance
- Applied consistent design patterns across all components:
  - Factory Pattern for component creation
  - Strategy Pattern for interchangeable implementations
  - Builder Pattern for complex object construction
  - Manager Pattern for collections management
  - Enum Pattern for type-safe categorical values

### Batch Processing Mode Design
1. **Architecture**:
   - Streamline output for scripting environments
   - Implement minimal progress indicators
   - Optimize for unattended execution
   - Support output file redirection
   - Enable quiet mode operation

2. **Integration Strategy**:
   - Build on existing AnalysisRunner
   - Integrate with output formatters for standardized results
   - Use minimal CLI progress display
   - Support all output format options
   - Enable environment variable configuration

3. **Extension Points**:
   - Custom batch job configuration
   - Scheduled execution capabilities
   - Exit code handling for scripting integration
   - Pipeline integration support
   - Batch configuration files

## Implementation Timeline

- ✅ **Week 1-2**: Visualization component implementation
- ✅ **Week 3-4**: Progress tracking system implementation
- ✅ **Week 5-6**: Interactive CLI mode implementation
- ✅ **Week 7-8**: Customizable output formatter implementation
- ✅ **Week 9**: Batch processing mode implementation
- **Week 10**: Documentation and comprehensive testing
- **Week 11**: Final integration and cleanup

## Risk Factors

1. **Visualization Library Compatibility**:
   - Risk: Selected libraries may not work well with all output formats
   - Mitigation: Evaluate multiple libraries and create adapter pattern for flexibility

2. **Progress Estimation Accuracy**:
   - Risk: Time remaining estimates may be inaccurate
   - Mitigation: Implement adaptive estimation based on completed tasks

3. **User Interface Consistency**:
   - Risk: Inconsistent presentation across different output formats
   - Mitigation: Create abstraction layer for UI components

## Active Decisions

### Implementation Approach
- Following modular design for each component
- Using builder pattern for complex object creation
- Implementing comprehensive test suite for all components
- Maintaining backward compatibility with existing components

### Backward Compatibility
- Enhanced recommendation system supports legacy string recommendations
- Analysis results maintain the established structure while extending it
- Results can be reported through any of the existing reporters

### Testing Strategy
- Each component has dedicated test files
- Both positive and negative test cases
- Integration tests ensure proper component interaction
- Example scripts demonstrate practical usage

This document will be updated as Phase 3 implementation progresses. 

## Recent Changes

- Implemented batch processing mode with minimal output
- Added machine-readable output format for integration with other tools
- Enhanced the CLI to better support batch processing with additional flags
- Created BatchFormatter class for optimized output in batch mode
- Added tests to verify batch processing functionality
- Created example scripts for batch processing

## Next Steps

1. Complete the documentation for batch processing
2. Add more examples of batch processing for practical use cases
3. Continue implementing the remaining features from the phase 3 checklist
4. Enhance error reporting with actionable suggestions
5. Address any issues identified during testing

## Active Decisions

- Batch mode forces minimal display style to reduce console output
- Machine-readable flag implies batch mode for easier scripting
- Batch output provides minimal but essential information (scores, critical issues)
- Detailed flag controls the level of detail in batch output
- Batch mode summary includes key metrics for scripting (URL, score, duration)
