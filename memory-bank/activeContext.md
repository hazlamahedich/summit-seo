4. Create cloud deployment approach

## Active Decisions

1. Phase 4 will focus on enterprise features including a web-based interface and cloud deployment options
2. The REST API will be built using FastAPI for performance and automatic documentation
3. Database integration will use SQLAlchemy for ORM capabilities with PostgreSQL as the primary backend
