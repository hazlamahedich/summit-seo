# Summit SEO - Active Development Context

## Current Focus

We have successfully implemented three key user experience features:

1. **Keyboard Shortcuts System** - A comprehensive system for registering, managing, and displaying keyboard shortcuts throughout the application with platform-specific formatting and persistence.

2. **Sound Effects System** - A subtle audio feedback system for UI interactions, using the Web Audio API with volume controls and mute functionality.

3. **Product Tour / Onboarding Flow** - A step-by-step guided tour system with element highlighting, responsive tooltips, and progress tracking.

4. **A/B Testing System** - A complete A/B testing infrastructure for UI/UX enhancements with experiment management, variant assignment, and conversion tracking.

These features have been integrated with each other to create a cohesive user experience:
- The product tour highlights keyboard shortcuts
- Sound effects play during tour progression and shortcut activation
- All systems support accessibility requirements
- A/B testing enables data-driven UI/UX decisions

## Documentation Updates
