# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
Phase 2 Complete - Preparing for Phase 3 Implementation

### Recent Changes
- Completed all Phase 2 components including:
  - PDF Reporter with comprehensive styling and customization options
  - Robots.txt Processor with directive parsing and SEO analysis
  - Sitemap Processor with URL extraction and validation
  - Test resources and documentation
- Implemented comprehensive testing framework:
  - Unit tests for all processors and reporters
  - Integration tests for component interactions
  - End-to-end workflow tests
  - Test resources with sample files for all components

### Active Decisions
- Established consistent patterns across all components:
  - Configuration-based approach
  - Comprehensive validation
  - Detailed analysis metrics
  - SEO-focused recommendations
- Test framework design:
  - pytest as the primary testing framework
  - Clear test organization following component structure
  - Test resources that exercise all key functionality

### Next Steps
1. Perform code quality review and optimization
2. Enhance test coverage and add performance benchmarks
3. Update documentation for all components
4. Begin implementation of Phase 3 components:
   - Security Analyzer
   - Performance Analyzer
   - Schema.org Analyzer
   - Accessibility Analyzer
   - Mobile Friendly Analyzer
   - Social Media Analyzer

### Current Challenges
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Test coverage metrics tracking
- Integration test completeness
- Phase 3 component prioritization

### Notes
- All Phase 2 components are now complete
- Testing framework is established with consistent methodology
- System architecture is proven with multiple processors and reporters
- Factory pattern enables easy extension with new components

## Design Decisions for Phase 3

1. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement caching mechanisms for repeated operations
   - Add parallel processing where appropriate
   - Optimize memory usage for large datasets
   - Profile key operations for bottlenecks

2. Testing Expansion:
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Increase test coverage to meet targets
   - Add more edge case testing
   - Implement regression test suite

3. Documentation:
   - Create comprehensive API documentation
   - Add usage examples for all components
   - Document extension points and customization options
   - Create architecture diagrams

## Current Considerations for Phase 3
- Component priority based on user value
- Performance optimization approaches
- Testing strategy for complex analyzers
- Documentation improvements

This document will be updated as Phase 3 planning progresses.
