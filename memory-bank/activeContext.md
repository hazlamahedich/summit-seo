## Next Steps

Continue Phase 4 implementation:
1. Develop database integration with SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL

   - Set up ORM models
   - Implement migration strategy
   - Design backup and recovery plan
2. Design cloud deployment architecture

## Active Decisions

1. Database integration will use SQLAlchemy for ORM capabilities with PostgreSQL as the primary backend
2. The database schema will be designed to support multi-tenant architecture
3. Migrations will be handled through Alembic to maintain database versioning
4. Cloud deployment will target AWS initially with potential for multi-cloud support

## Considerations for Phase 4

- Database performance optimization strategies
- Connection pooling and query optimization
- Data partitioning for large datasets
- Backup and disaster recovery processes
- Cloud infrastructure as code (using Terraform)
- Containerization with Docker and Kubernetes
- CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
- Monitoring and alerting setup

# Active Context

## Current Focus
We have completed the database integration phase, implementing a comprehensive multi-tenant database schema with SQLAlchemy and Alembic for migrations. The implementation includes:

1. Core Models:
   - User and Role management
   - Multi-tenant support with Tenant and TenantUser models
   - Project and Analysis tracking
   - Findings and Recommendations storage

2. Database Infrastructure:
   - SQLAlchemy ORM setup with PostgreSQL support
   - Alembic migration system
   - Database initialization and seeding scripts
   - Environment-based configuration

3. Next Steps:
   - Create initial migration using create_initial_migration.py
   - Initialize database using init_db.py
   - Update API routes to use database models
   - Begin cloud deployment phase

## Recent Changes
- Implemented complete database schema design
- Set up SQLAlchemy ORM with multi-tenant support
- Created Alembic migration system
- Added database initialization and seeding scripts
- Updated project checklist to reflect database integration completion

## Active Decisions
1. Database Architecture:
   - Using PostgreSQL as primary database
   - SQLite for local development
   - Multi-tenant design with tenant isolation
   - Soft delete support for all models

2. Migration Strategy:
   - Using Alembic for version control
   - Automatic migration generation
   - Support for both upgrade and downgrade paths
   - Environment-based configuration

3. Data Seeding:
   - Default roles (admin, manager, user)
   - Initial admin user creation
   - Environment-based configuration for admin credentials

## Current Considerations
- Database performance optimization for large datasets
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Data migration strategy for production deployment
