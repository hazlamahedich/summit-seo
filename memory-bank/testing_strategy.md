# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Summit SEO project.

## API Testing Approach

### Test Framework

The API testing is built on pytest, which provides a powerful and flexible framework for testing Python code. Key features used:

- **Fixtures**: Reusable components that set up test prerequisites
- **Parametrization**: Run tests with different inputs
- **Mocking**: Replace real components with test doubles
- **Assertions**: Verify expected behavior

### Test Directory Structure

```
summit_seo/web/api/tests/
├── conftest.py             # Common fixtures and utilities
├── minimal_conftest.py     # Simplified config for validation issues
├── pytest.ini              # Pytest configuration
├── .env                    # Environment variables for testing
├── README.md               # Testing documentation
├── test_auth_endpoints.py  # Authentication endpoint tests
├── test_users_endpoints.py # User endpoint tests
└── ...                     # Other endpoint tests
```

### Fixture Strategy

The testing approach uses fixtures to provide:

1. **Test Data**: Sample users, projects, analyses, etc.
2. **Mock Components**: Mocked Supabase client, database connections
3. **Test Client**: FastAPI TestClient for making requests
4. **Configuration**: Test settings that avoid validation issues

### Mocking Strategy

External dependencies are mocked to isolate tests:

- **Supabase Client**: Mock authentication and database operations
- **Settings**: Mock configuration to avoid environment dependencies
- **Database**: Mock database operations to avoid real database
- **Dependencies**: Mock FastAPI dependencies for authentication

### Environment Management

Testing environment is managed through:

1. **pytest.ini**: Configure pytest behavior and environment variables
2. **.env**: Provide environment variables for tests
3. **monkeypatch**: Override environment variables during tests

### Challenges and Solutions

#### Settings Validation

Pydantic settings validation poses challenges for testing. Solutions include:

1. **Environment Variables**: Set required variables in test environment
2. **Mock Settings**: Replace settings object with test double
3. **Fixture Approach**: Provide test settings via fixtures

#### Supabase Mocking

Supabase client requires careful mocking:

1. **Auth Methods**: Mock sign up, sign in, and token verification
2. **Database Methods**: Mock table operations and query results
3. **Response Format**: Ensure mocked responses match expected format

## Future Improvements

1. **Test Coverage**: Implement coverage reporting
2. **Integration Tests**: Add tests with real database for critical flows
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Automate testing in CI/CD pipeline
4. **Performance Testing**: Add load and performance tests
5. **Security Testing**: Add security-focused tests
